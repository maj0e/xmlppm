XMLPPM 0.98 TODO

James Cheney 3/19/2001

* Fix the entity behavior so that the XML text is preserved as exactly
as possible

* Factor the XMLUNPPM component into an "event decoder" that decodes the
compressed event stream and calls an arbitrary SAX event handler, and a 
"printing" event handler.

* Port to other XML parsing libraries

* Add the capability to directly compress/decompress XML stored in memory
as DOM trees

5/19/2001

* Remove 255-element/attribute symbol limitation


2/11/2003

* Library-ize xmlppm so that applications can compress XML text or DOM
trees from memory to memory rather than only to/from files.


5/6/2006

* Use autoconf/automake to detect whether xerces, expat, or libxml2 is installed and provide appropriate interfaces.

* Provide callback and buffer-based processing options to enable compressing xml text from/to memory rather than files.

* Use Xerces-C++ SAX/DOM abstractions to simplify the above?

* Provide JNI-binding?


Library plan:

1.  Abstract method of outputing compressed byte stream out of PPM models/coder.

2.  Provide compression and decompression as a C++-like class/component.

3.  Provide C external interfaces.  Can C code call C++ code?
